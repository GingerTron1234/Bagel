        <p>I finally go the blog page setup, WOOHOO!
        Eventually I'll get to making everything resizable. I also kinda want the blog posts to have their own style.</p>
        <p>Now that every blog has it's own page I can add things like this cool pic of my PC setup: </p>
        <img src="blog_images/2024-01-09-gamer-setup.jpg">
        <p>Ignore the bad camera quality I took the photo on my laptop.</p>
        <p>I mainly use my PC for gaming and my laptop for programming since it runs Linux.</p>
        <p>In other news I got the day off today cause of icy rain. That's what allowed me to update the site.
        I'm getting a book on Golang tomorrow so I'll be able to make a web server and more software in the future.</p>
