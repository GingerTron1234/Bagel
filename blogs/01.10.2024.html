        <p>I got the book on Go today!
        It was written by the same guy that wrote The C Programming Language so it should be good, and by the looks of it it is.</p>
        <p>Here's the book: </p>

        <p>I forgot to make a blog post about this but I ended up finishing the C programming language book awhile ago.
             It's definitely come in handy for programming a bunch of stuff.
        </p> 
        <p>I feel like just being in school makes me exhausted and not want to program, but I'll come through and still do it. 
            If I don't update the blog for a bit that's probably why.</p>
