        <p>When I was reading the book on GoLang I quickly realised this wasn't the most powerful language for game development so I looked for another.</p>
        <p>(I will come back to go though when I need to make a server for the website or something.)</p>
        <br>
        <p>I started learning C# since the MonoGame framework is just so good especially for making games.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite games were made with it like Terraria and Celeste.</p>
        <p>I've been trying pretty hard to figure it out. What keeps me wanting to come back is the fact that all of Terraria was made with the language. That's insane!</p>
        <p>Alright that's I'll post back here in two months.</p>
