    <h1 class="center">03/18/2024, Not gonna host the sites servers.</h1>
    <hr class="thick">
    <div class="center" style="line-height: 3vmin;">

        <p>I decided not to host the servers because it'll cost to much to pay for my own internet and router.</p>
        <p>I have to have a connected connection to make the site connection more secure. Without that I may as well host the site on Github Pages.</p>
        <br>
        <p>But I'll do something else for the sites birthday instead. I've been making games using pygame recently and want to release a big'ish sized game by june 15th. (The sites birthday)</p>
        
        <p>I'll make another blog post when I have an update on the game's development... Or on the game's release.</p>
