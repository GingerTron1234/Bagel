        <p>My birthday's on Apiril 7th!!! I'm gonna end up going to TGI Fridays (For the fried green beans). 
            Then after I'll watch wrestlmania 40 when it comes on that night!
        </p>
        <p>
            In other news I don't think I'm gonna make a game for the sites birthday. I've pretty much only been doing what I want to do when it comes to programming.
            Whether it be making some small game in python or trying to make an AI I've been sticking to smaller projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I do feel like this is better for me though since I'll be able to get skill in a variety of subjects and won't get burnt out getting fusturated while trying to do the same thing over and over again.
            But eventually when I get good enough at programming in general I'll stick more towards bigger projects. (I'll eventually feel the need to get more programming knowledge).
        </p>

            Alright well that's pretty much it, I'll blog again next month or whenever I feel like blogging.
