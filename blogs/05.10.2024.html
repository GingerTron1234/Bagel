        <p>I'm tired of programming smaller things now so I've told myself if I don't program a bigger game I'm not gonna work on anything at all.</p>
        <p>I'm gonna make a game like Dwarf Fortress but instead of controlling Dwarves you're controlling Goblins. I'll call it... Goblin Fortress!</p>
        <p>Instead of having graphics allowing you to control the Goblins from the upward perspective I'm gonna have it all be in the terminal.<br>
        If you wanna send your goblins to dig a hole you would have to type in a command. If you want them to steal from another fortress that would be a command ect.<br>
        The thing is all these actions would take up a different amount of time. As time goes by food and other resources will go down, while happiness will change based on how the Goblins are feeling.<br>
        The reason I'm doing it this way is to stick apart from Dwarf Fortress and It'll allow me to program the fun bits a lot more. (Everything that has nothing to do with graphics.)</p>
        <p>The entire game will be programmed in C++ and I'm hoping to have it done at some point over summer. I'll post it to the website and update the blog when it's complete.</p>
        <p>As I said earlier I'm not gonna start any other projects until this is done. I've been wanting to make a game like this for awhile now and now's the time to do it.</p>
