        <p>I've learned a lot about C++ and development has been going well.
        <br>I still definately have a lot more to learn, but I'm having a lot of fun while doing it!</p>
        <p>I get out of school on May 31st, so by then I'll be able to get a lot more done.</p>
        <p>This is a pretty short blog, but I just wanted to let all of you know that I'm actually sticking to the same project.</p>
