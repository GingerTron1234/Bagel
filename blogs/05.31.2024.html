        <p>A week or so ago I decided to take a break from programming Goblin Fortress until summer had started. 
            I did this so I could focus on the project day in and day out without school taking time out of my day.
            <br>During this time I managed to finish reading Fellowship of the Ring and beat the first Dark Souls.</p>
        <p>And well, summer has finally started!</p>
        <p>I'm not gonna make another blog post until the game has been released.</p>
