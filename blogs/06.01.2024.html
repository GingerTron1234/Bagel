            I just finished developing Goblin Fortress. I restarted everything right after I posted the last blog.
            I did this because I wanted to change the way the game works. In the old version it would simulate things coming toward your fortress and all that.
            You would have to go forward each tick which would be really annoying. So I decided to instead make it so everything is generalized. The movement of each entity isn't simulated it's just one big thing.
            I definitely had a lot of fun working on this project and will work on another one later tonight. I'm gonna try to make something with actual graphics.
            The game will be released on the website here soon, and the source code is right <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Wardence1/Goblin-Fortress">here</a>.
