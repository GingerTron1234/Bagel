        <p>
            The new game I'm making is a puzzle platformer where you're able to save and load checkpoints.
            An example of a puzzle would be where you jump down off of something then load your checkpoint over breakable blocks to use your momentum and break them.
            The game's entirely made using C++ with the SFML library.<br>Here's a video of the very basic prototype I have of the game: </p>

            <p>The video couldn't load or is not supported by your browser.</p>
            </video>
            <p>Also the site birthday's coming up on June 15th. I feel like I'm not gonna be able to do too much for it since I'm putting all my time into the game. Oh well.</p>
