        <ul>
            <li>I ended up getting a laptop for christmas that I downloaded linux on.</li>
            <li>Also I'm getting a book on the Golang programming language on wednesday.
            <br>The language will allow me to program my own web server so I won't have to rely on Github to host the website.</li>
            <li>I'll probably end up porting the site over to my own web server on the sites birthday in June.</li>
            <li>Also I need to make a new blog page. I was thinking of making a grid with the date and title of each blog, then you can click on any one of them to open an entire page for each blog post.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10/25/2023, 3:45PM</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I decided to change the core concept of the website.</li>
            <li>Not that I didn't want to, I just feel like this new versions gonna work out a lot better, and will be easier to make for someone new to PHP.</li>
            <li>I'll also be keeping the layout and most of the code from the old website, I'm just gonna change it to fit my new concept.</li>
            
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h2>10/23/2023, 5:23PM</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Worked quite a lot on the new website today.</li>
            <li>I found a new style for that looks nice to me.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h2>10/23/2023, 11:56AM</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Realised I should add the time to each one of these so I added that.</li>
            <li>My mom said she would get me a book on php around halloween so I've been holding off on doing that on the big website coming up.</li>
            <li>So I'll have to focus on the html and the css of the new website first.</li>
            <li>I'm also still learning stuff about C; I'm almost on the third chapter of the book.</li>

                (From the book by Dennis Riche and Brian Kerningham.)</li>
            <li>I'll definatley finish the book while working on this website.</li>
            <li>I made a word program posted <a target="_blank" class="paraLink" href="https://github.com/Wardence1/Word-Helper" title="My github repository, obviously.">here</a> on github.</li>
